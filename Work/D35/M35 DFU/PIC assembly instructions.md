- `goto main`: This instruction jumps to the main program.
    
    ​
- `org 0x04`: This instruction sets the address where the interrupt routine will start.
    
    ​
- `retfie`: This instruction tells the PIC that the interrupt routine has finished and the Program Counter will point back to the main program.
    
    ​
- `bsf INTCON,7`: This instruction sets the GIE (Global Interrupt Enable) bit in the INTCON register to enable interrupts.
    
    ​
- `bsf INTCON,4`: This instruction sets the INTE (RB0 Interrupt Enable) bit in the INTCON register to enable RB0 pin as an interrupt pin.
    
    ​
- `bcf INTCON,1`: This instruction clears the INTF (Interrupt Flag) bit in the INTCON register.
    
    ​
- `bsf STATUS,5`: This instruction switches to Bank 1 in the STATUS register.
    
    ​
- `movlw 0x01`: This instruction moves the value 0x01 into the W register.
    
    ​
- `movwf TRISB`: This instruction moves the value in the W register to the TRISB register, setting RB0 as an input.
    
    ​
- `movlw 0x10`: This instruction moves the value 0x10 into the W register.
    
    ​
- `movwf TRISA`: This instruction moves the value in the W register to the TRISA register, setting the first 4 pins on PortA as output.
    
    ​
- `bcf STATUS,5`: This instruction switches back to Bank 0 in the STATUS register.
    
    ​
- `movf COUNT into W`: This instruction moves the contents of the COUNT variable into the W register.
    
    ​
- `movwf PORTA`: This instruction moves the value in the W register to the PORTA register.
    
    ​
- `goto loop`: This instruction jumps back to the loop label, continuing the loop.
    
    ​
- `clrf COUNT`: This instruction clears the COUNT variable, setting it back to 0.
    
    ​
- `bcf INTCON,1`: This instruction clears the INTF (Interrupt Flag) bit in the INTCON register.
    
    ​
- `movfw TEMP`: This instruction moves the value in the TEMP register to the W register.
    
    ​
- `retfie`: This instruction returns from the interrupt routine.
    
    ​
- `incf COUNT,1`: This instruction increments the COUNT variable by 1.
    
    ​
- `movlw 0x0A`: This instruction moves the value 0x0A into the W register.
    
    ​
- `subwf COUNT,0`: This instruction subtracts the value in the W register from the COUNT variable and stores the result in the W register.
    
    ​
- `btfss STATUS,0`: This instruction checks the Carry flag in the STATUS register.
    
    ​
    
    If the Carry flag is set, it skips the next instruction.
    
    ​
- `goto carry_on`: This instruction jumps to the carry_on label.
    
    ​
- `goto clear`: This instruction jumps to the clear label.
- `clrf COUNT`: This instruction clears the COUNT variable, setting it back to 0.
    
    ​
- `bcf INTCON,1`: This instruction clears the INTF (Interrupt Flag) bit in the INTCON register.
    
    ​
- `retfie`: This instruction returns from the interrupt routine.
