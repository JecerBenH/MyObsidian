# Project Specification: Anti-Theft Device with Accelerometer and LoRaWAN Communication

#### Overview

This project aims to develop an anti-theft system on outdoor BWS IOT devices leveraging an STM32 microcontroller for monitoring an object's movement through an accelerometer. The device will detect unauthorized movement (indicative of theft), and upon such detection, it will communicate with gateways using LoRaWAN to send alerts along with the GPS coordinates of its location.

#### Components

- **STM32 Microcontroller:** The core processing unit that manages sensor data acquisition, theft detection algorithms, LoRaWAN communication, and GPS data handling.
- **Accelerometer:** To detect movement of the device. The accelerometer must be capable of interfacing with the STM32 via I2C.
- **GPS Module:** For acquiring the geographical location of the device. The module should be compatible with the STM32, preferably using UART for communication.
- **LoRaWAN Module:** For wireless communication over long distances. This module will send alerts and GPS coordinates to predefined gateways.
- **Power Supply:** A battery with sufficient capacity to ensure prolonged operation of the device, along with a power management circuit.

#### Functional Requirements

- **Data Acquisition:** The STM32 microcontroller must continuously monitor the accelerometer's data via I2C to detect any movement.
- **Theft Detection:** The device will implement an algorithm to differentiate between normal and unauthorized movement patterns, triggering an alert upon detection of the latter.
- **LoRaWAN Communication:** Upon theft detection, the device must automatically send an alert to predefined gateways using the LoRaWAN module. The alert message should include the device ID and the current GPS coordinates.
- **GPS Data Acquisition:** The device must periodically acquire its geographical location via the GPS module and be prepared to send this data along with theft alerts.
- **Low Power Mode:** The device should operate in a low power mode when no movement is detected to conserve battery life.

#### Software Requirements

- **Firmware Development:** Use C for STM32 firmware development, ensuring compatibility with the hardware peripherals (I2C for accelerometer).
- **Theft Detection Algorithm:** Implement an algorithm capable of analyzing accelerometer data to accurately detect unauthorized movement.
- **GPS Data Handling:** Develop routines for alerting by sending LoRa messages and coordinations to Gateways without overflowing the network.

#### Hardware Interface

- **Accelerometer Interface:** The accelerometer is already connected on BWS GPS module devices.

#### Security and Reliability

- **Data Encryption:** All communications over LoRaWAN must be encrypted to ensure the security of transmitted data.
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling and recovery mechanisms must be in place to ensure reliable operation under various conditions.

#### Documentation

- Provide comprehensive documentation covering the software codebase, API references, and user manuals.

#### Compliance and Certifications

- BWS devices are compliant with local regulations for wireless communication.
